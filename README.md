## Dataset
### https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadehsan000/real-estate-data-for-the-usa
The dataset used in this project includes various attributes related to real estate properties. Some of the key features are:

- **ID**: Unique identifier for each property
- **Location**: Geographical location of the property
- **Price**: Listing price of the property
- **Area**: Total area of the property in square feet
- **Bedrooms**: Number of bedrooms
- **Bathrooms**: Number of bathrooms
- **Year Built**: The year the property was constructed
- **Property Type**: Type of property (e.g., apartment, house)


## Exploratory Data Analysis
The EDA process includes the following steps:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates.
Descriptive Statistics: Generating summary statistics for the dataset.
Data Visualization: Creating various plots (e.g., histograms, scatter plots) to understand the data distribution and relationships between variables.
Correlation Analysis: Exploring correlations between different features and their impact on property prices.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features from the existing data to enhance the analysis.
## Results
The EDA revealed several key insights:

List any important findings such as trends, correlations, or patterns discovered during the analysis.
Highlight any significant visualizations or analysis steps.
## Conclusion
This project successfully identified key factors influencing property prices and provided actionable insights. Further analysis could include predictive modeling or deeper exploration of specific factors.
