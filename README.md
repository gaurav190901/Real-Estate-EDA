## Dataset

[Real Estate Data for the USA](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadehsan000/real-estate-data-for-the-usa)

The dataset used in this project includes various attributes related to real estate properties. Some of the key features are:

- **ID**: Unique identifier for each property
- **Location**: Geographical location of the property
- **Price**: Listing price of the property
- **Area**: Total area of the property in square feet
- **Bedrooms**: Number of bedrooms
- **Bathrooms**: Number of bathrooms
- **Year Built**: The year the property was constructed
- **Property Type**: Type of property (e.g., apartment, house)

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The EDA process includes the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates.
2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Generating summary statistics for the dataset.
3. **Data Visualization**: Creating various plots (e.g., histograms, scatter plots) to understand the data distribution and relationships between variables.
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Exploring correlations between different features and their impact on property prices.
5. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features from the existing data to enhance the analysis.

## Results

The EDA revealed several key insights:

- Identified key factors influencing property prices, such as location, area, and number of bedrooms.
- Discovered significant correlations between property prices and various features.
- Created visualizations that effectively highlight trends and patterns, aiding decision-making for property investments.

## Challenges Faced

- **Data Quality Issues**: Addressed missing values and inconsistencies through thorough data cleaning.
- **Complex Relationships**: Navigated and interpreted complex relationships between multiple features influencing property prices.
- **Feature Engineering**: Balanced the creation of new features with maintaining simplicity and analytical value.

## Learnings

- Enhanced skills in EDA techniques and data preparation.
- Gained experience in creating effective visualizations to communicate findings.
- Reinforced the importance of feature engineering in data analysis.
